TODOs:

1. Remove gene-check dependency. All that really needs to be done is use mrnaToGene to create the genePreds then convert those to bed. HOWEVER, this will lose the red/green annotation that gene-check adds. Therefore, need to add code to the annotation pipeline to make a new BED with these, using the data in the databases. This would replace the part of buildTracks.py where we symlink the input BED files.
2. Fully merge the hal2assemblyhub script so that we don't pull out the sequences from the hal twice.
3. Incorporate more metrics, such as Dent's coverage plots.
4. Add another makefile for creating delta coverage plots, based on how many releases are in the folder?
5. Previously existing problems. Classifiers should be ran against the
original annotations and placed on the reference genome in the assemblyHub.
6. Create a hgSql query for the attributes file, remove the hard-coded file.
